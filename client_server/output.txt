In addition to encryption, another security mechanism often used in distributed systems is authentication and authorization. As the name suggests, this mechanism involves two continuous processes. 
Authentication is a process by which one principal verifies the identity of another principal. When a principal sends a request for accessing certain resources in a distributed system, certain types of credentials need to be provided to the system reference monitor. A reference monitor is a module that examines each request for the resources in a distributed system. Some common credentials are usernames, fingerprints, and passwords. After the request arrives on some channel (connection), such as a network port, a system call, or a pipe, the monitor checks the credentials and deduces the identity of the principal who sent the request. If the credentials match, the monitor concludes that the principal is who he or she claims to be. Then the channel is authenticated. If the credentials do not match, the monitor closes the channel. 
Single-factor authentication, which requires only one category of credentials, is used in most cases. If the resources are very important and need strict protection, multifactor authentication is used. For example, a user may need to swipe a card, then scan a fingerprint, and finally answer a security question to access a bank account. In this case, three types of credentials are checked by the monitor, one by one. 
After the authentication process is finished and the principal’s identity is verified, the monitor needs to decide whether the resources that the principal wants to access are indeed accessible. Authentication merely ensures that the principal is who he or she claims to be. Authorization, on the other hand, determines whether the authenticated principal has access to the particular resources. To do this, the monitor uses an access control list (ACL). An ACL is a set of access rules that specifies a set of authorized principals for each operation (a request). ACLs are usually attached to the resources. The monitor authorizes a principal by interpreting the access rule. If the interpreted access rule specifies that the principal does have access to the particular resources, the monitor grants the request. Otherwise, the monitor denies the request. 
This is very well done. Your process is clear and detailed, and it flows nicely. 
Consider these corrections and suggestions:
1)	“Besides” and “if so/if not” are both informal and conversational.
2)	When 3 or more items are joined with “and,” a comma before “and” is optional.  However, most style manuals recommend using a comma for clarity.
3)	Be careful with subject/verb agreement (the resources are).

This is very well done. Your process is clear and detailed, and it flows nicely. JiachenIn addition to encryption, another security mechanism often used in distributed systems is authentication and authorization. As the name suggests, this mechanism involves two continuous processes. 
Authentication is a process by which one principal verifies the identity of another principal. When a principal sends a request for accessing certain resources in a distributed system, certain types of credentials need to be provided to the system reference monitor. A reference monitor is a module that examines each request for the resources in a distributed system. Some common credentials are usernames, fingerprints, and passwords. After the request arrives on some channel (connection), such as a network port, a system call, or a pipe, the monitor checks the credentials and deduces the identity of the principal who sent the request. If the credentials match, the monitor concludes that the principal is who he or she claims to be. Then the channel is authenticated. If the credentials do not match, the monitor closes the channel. 
Single-factor authentication, which requires only one category of credentials, is used in most cases. If the resources are very important and need strict protection, multifactor authentication is used. For example, a user may need to swipe a card, then scan a fingerprint, and finally answer a security question to access a bank account. In this case, three types of credentials are checked by the monitor, one by one. 
After the authentication process is finished and the principal’s identity is verified, the monitor needs to decide whether the resources that the principal wants to access are indeed accessible. Authentication merely ensures that the principal is who he or she claims to be. Authorization, on the other hand, determines whether the authenticated principal has access to the particular resources. To do this, the monitor uses an access control list (ACL). An ACL is a set of access rules that specifies a set of authorized principals for each operation (a request). ACLs are usually attached to the resources. The monitor authorizes a principal by interpreting the access rule. If the interpreted access rule specifies that the principal does have access to the particular resources, the monitor grants the request. Otherwise, the monitor denies the request. 
This is very well done. Your process is clear and detailed, and it flows nicely.

If the interpreted access rule specifies that the principal does have access to the particular resources, the monitor grants the request. Otherwise, the monitor denies the request. 
This is very well done. Your process is clear and detailed, and it flows nicely. JiachenIn addition to encryption, another security mechanism often used in distributed systems is authentication and authorization. As the name suggests, this mechanism involves two continuous processes. 
Authentication is a process by which one principal verifies the identity of another principal. When a principal sends a request for accessing certain resources in a distributed system, certain types of credentials need to be provided to the system reference monitor. A reference monitor is a module that examines each request for the resources in a distributed system. Some common credentials are usernames, fingerprints, and passwords. After the request arrives on some channel (connection), such as a network port, a system call, or a pipe, the monitor checks the credentials and deduces the identity of the principal who sent the request. If the credentials match, the monitor concludes that the principal is who he or she claims to be. Then the channel is authenticated. If the credentials do not match, the monitor closes the channel. 
Single-factor authentication, which requires only one category of credentials, is used in most cases. If the resources are very important and need strict protection, multifactor authentication is used. For example, a user may need to swipe a card, then scan a fingerprint, and finally answer a security question to access a bank account. In this case, three types of credentials are checked by the monitor, one by one. 
After the authentication process is finished and the principal’s identity is verified, the monitor needs to decide whether the resources that the principal wants to access are indeed accessible. Authentication merely ensures that the principal is who he or she claims to be. Authorization, on the other hand, determines whether the authenticated principal has access to the particular resources. To do this, the monitor uses an access control list (ACL). An ACL is a set of access rules that specifies a set of authorized principals for each operation (a request). ACLs are usually attached to the resources. The monitor authorizes a principal by interpreting the access rule. If the interpreted access rule specifies that the principal does have access to the particular resources, the monitor grants the request. Otherwise, the monitor denies the request. 
This is very well done. Your process is clear and detailed, and it flows nicely.

Authentication merely ensures that the principal is who he or she claims to be. Authorization, on the other hand, determines whether the authenticated principal has access to the particular resources. To do this, the monitor uses an access control list (ACL). An ACL is a set of access rules that specifies a set of authorized principals for each operation (a request). ACLs are usually attached to the resources. The monitor authorizes a principal by interpreting the access rule. If the interpreted access rule specifies that the principal does have access to the particular resources, the monitor grants the request. Otherwise, the monitor denies the request. 
This is very well done. Your process is clear and detailed, and it flows nicely. JiachenIn addition to encryption, another security mechanism often used in distributed systems is authentication and authorization. As the name suggests, this mechanism involves two continuous processes. 
Authentication is a process by which one principal verifies the identity of another principal. When a principal sends a request for accessing certain resources in a distributed system, certain types of credentials need to be provided to the system reference monitor. A reference monitor is a module that examines each request for the resources in a distributed system. Some common credentials are usernames, fingerprints, and passwords. After the request arrives on some channel (connection), such as a network port, a system call, or a pipe, the monitor checks the credentials and deduces the identity of the principal who sent the request. If the credentials match, the monitor concludes that the principal is who he or she claims to be. Then the channel is authenticated. If the credentials do not match, the monitor closes the channel. 
Single-factor authentication, which requires only one category of credentials, is used in most cases. If the resources are very important and need strict protection, multifactor authentication is used. For example, a user may need to swipe a card, then scan a fingerprint, and finally answer a security question to access a bank account. In this case, three types of credentials are checked by the monitor, one by one.

Consider these corrections and suggestions:
1)	“Besides” and “if so/if not” are both informal and conversational.
2)	When 3 or more items are joined with “and,” a comma before “and” is optional.  However, most style manuals recommend using a comma for clarity.
3)	Be careful with subject/verb agreement (the resources are).
